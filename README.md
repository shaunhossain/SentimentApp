# SentimentApp
Sentiment analysis or opinion analysis is creating a vast area of research in this modern era of social media. Various blogs and social medias (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) are the most popular platform for the users or consumers where they frequently express their opinion about current topics, various brands, restaurants, movies, books, traveling places etc. In this project, we proposed a presentable procedure to predict user sentiments from their online reviews given for different businesses by using majority voting classification techniques. Our application will give a hand to business owners to identify their customer’s feedbacks and market positions and it’s also helped a person to identify which one is the best restaurant according to user reviews. Our system uses Watson Tone Analyzer for pre-processing the dataset and uses countvectorizer to extract features. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed techniques are efficient and performs better than previously proposed methods. In our research, we worked with English, however, the proposed technique can be used with any other language.
